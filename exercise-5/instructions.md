Santa ðŸŽ… is testing his new electric sled, the CyberReindeer, on a North Pole road. The road is represented by a string of characters, where:

<span style="color:#f0ad4e">

- ```.``` = Road
- ```S``` = Santa's Sled
- ```*``` = Open barrier
- ```|``` = Closed barrier

</span>

Example of a road: ```S...|....|.....```

Each unit of time, <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**the sled moves one position to the right.**</span> If it encounters a closed barrier, it stops until the barrier opens. If it is open, it goes through directly.

<span style="color:#f0ad4e">**All barriers start closed**</span>, but after 5 units of time, they all open <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**forever**</span>.

<span style="color:#f0ad4e">**Create a function that simulates the sled's movement**</span> for a given time and <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**returns an array**</span> of strings representing the state of the road at each unit of time:

```js
const road = 'S..|...|..'
const time = 10 // units of time
const result = cyberReindeer(road, time)

/* -> result:
[
  'S..|...|..', // initial state
  '.S.|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled advances on the road
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '..S|...|..', // sled stops at the barrier
  '...S...*..', // barrier opens, sled advances
  '...*S..*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*.S.*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*..S*..', // sled advances on the road
  '...*...S..', // passes through the open barrier
]
*/
```

The result is an <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**array where each element shows the road at each unit of time.**</span>

Take into account that <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**if the sled is in the same position as a barrier**</span>, then it takes its place in the array.
