What an idea Sam Elfman has had! He wants to offer a service that creates a <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**customized Christmas tree**</span> ðŸŽ„ in a matter of seconds.

To create it, we are given a <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**string to form the tree**</span> and a <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**number that indicates its height.**</span>

Each character of the string represents an ornament of the tree, and we use them <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**cyclically**</span> until we reach the indicated height. At <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**least, they will always pass us one.**</span>

We must return a multiline <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**string**</span> with the Christmas tree made with the ornaments, the indicated height <span style="color:#f0ad4e">**plus a final line with the trunk formed by the character ```|```**</span> in the center and, finally, a newline ```\n```.

For example, if we receive the string "123" and the number 4 as height, we would have to build this tree:

```js
   1
  2 3
 1 2 3
1 2 3 1
   |
```

If we receive the string *@o and the number 3, the tree we should return is:

```js
  *
 @ o
* @ o
  |
```

Note:

<span style="color:#f0ad4e">

- The tree should always be centered, for that reason add blank spaces to the left of each line.
- Create spaces only to the left of each line of the tree. Do not leave blank spaces to the right.
- The ornaments have a white space between them for separation.
